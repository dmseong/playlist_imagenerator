This web application allows users to generate a playlist cover image based on the musical features of selected songs. By analyzing audio data, it creates a visual representation of the playlist's vibe.

## Features
- Search songs by title or artist using the **[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)**.
- Fetch preview URLs from **[Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/)** for selected songs.
- Analyze audio features such as tempo, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth using **Librosa**.
- Aggregate the features of selected songs to determine the playlist's mood.
- Generate a playlist cover using Hugging Face's **Stable Diffusion** model based on the aggregated audio features.
- Customize the cover style (Color, Character, Landscape, or Abstract).
